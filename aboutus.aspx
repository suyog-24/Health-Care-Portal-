The Doctor Advisor service runs alongside  Counselling giving doctors and medical students in distress or difficulty the choice of speaking in confidence to another doctor.

<p align="left" style="color: #3333CC; font-weight: bold">If you wish to use the service call 0330 123 1245 and ask to speak to a Doctor 
    Advisor - you will be given the name of a doctor to contact and details of their 
    availability. This is not an emergency service and if you find yourself in such 
    a situation, please get appropriate help from either your own GP or usual 
    medical advisor</p>
<p align="left" style="color: #3333CC; font-weight: bold">.

Doctor Advisors do not provide diagnoses or treatment, although inevitably any interaction will have a therapeutic aspect.

As with  Counselling, once you have made contact with a particular Doctor Advisor you may contact them as many times as you feel necessary and there is no limit on how long you stay in touch for.
    Counselling is staffed by professional telephone counsellors 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They are all members of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy and are
     bound by strict codes of confidentiality and ethical practice. You can even choose to remain anonymous when you call.

        Doctor Advisors provide their services on a voluntary basis and are not 
        employees or agents of the BMA.&nbsp;Accordingly, the BMA is not responsible for any 
        acts or omissions by any of those Doctor Advisors or for the non-availability of 
        a Doctor Advisor.</p>
